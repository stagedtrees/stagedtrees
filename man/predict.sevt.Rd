\title{Predict method for staged event tree}
\usage{
\method{predict}{sevt}(object, newdata = NULL, class = NULL,
  prob = FALSE, log = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A staged event tree}

\item{newdata}{The newdata to perform predictions}

\item{class}{A string indicating the name of the variable to use as
the class variable, otherwise the first name in \code{names(object$tree)}
will be used.}

\item{prob}{logical, if \code{TRUE} the probabilities of class are
returned}

\item{log}{logical, if \code{TRUE} log-probabilities are returned}

\item{...}{additional parameters, see details}
}
\value{
A vector of predictions or the corresponding probabilities
}
\description{
Predict method for staged event tree
}
\details{
Predict the most probable a posterior value for the class variable
given all the other variables in the model. Ties are broken at random and
if, for a given vector of predictor variables, all conditional probabilities
are 0, NA is returned.

if \code{prob = TRUE}, a matrix with number of rows equals to the number of
rows in the \code{newdata} and number of columns as the number of levels of the
\code{class} variable is returned. if \code{log = TRUE}, log-probabilities are returned.

if \code{prob = FALSE}, a vector of length as the number of rows in the \code{newdata}
with the level with higher estimated probability for each new observations is returned.
