\title{Trajectories of hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients}
\format{
A data frame with 10000 observations of 4 variables.
The variables and their levels are as follows:
\itemize{
\item Sex: Female, Male
\item Age: 0-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80+
\item ICU: yes, no
\item death: yes, no
}
}
\source{
The data has been generated with the code in the Examples section.
Conditional probabilities were copied from the tables in the
Supplementary materials of Lefrancq et al. (2021).

\description{
Dataset with observations from four variables (Sex, Age,
ICU, death) for 10000 simulated SARS-CoV-2 hospital patients.
}
\details{
The data are simulated from an event tree where conditional
probabilities for ICU and death are taken from the results of
Lefrancq et al. (2021).
Lefrancq et al. (2021) estimated such probabilities from data
on patients, recorded in the
SI-VIC database, who started their hospitalization between
13 March and 30 November 2020.
Marginal probabilities of gender and
probabilities of age given gender were instead
obtained from the linked GitHub repository
