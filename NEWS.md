# 2.1.0 

* implemented various conversion algorithms between `sevt` 
  and DAG representations.
* improve implementation of `as_sevt.bn.fit`.
* use \pkg instead of \code for package names in documentation.
* fix `find_stage`.
* fix problems with single-variable staged trees.
* fix `summary.sevt` for objects without `ctables`. 
* fix bug in `path_probability` and `prob` for sevt objects with not 
  ordered `$prob`.
* more tests.

# 2.0.1

fix color assignment consistency between `plot.sevt` and `barplot.sevt`

# 2.0.0

This version introduces major changes, in functions capabilities
and in functions naming. 
These changes are almost surely breaking any previous code 
using older versions of the package.
In particular, all functions named `*.sevt` but class methods are now
called differently.
Moreover, various improvements and functionalities are added 
to better deal with unobserved situations and to improve 
computations. 
Additional model selection methods based on clustering are
now available.

COMPLETE CHANGELOG:

* DESCRIPTION updated.
* documentation updated.
* improve code comments.
* reduced exported functions.
* removed the `fit` parameter from `full`, `indep`. 
   Now `full` and `indep` always fit the model while
  `sevt` is just the basic constructor of the `sevt` class.
* in `full` and `indep` by default unobserved situations are joined
  using `join_unobserved`, and probabilities are fitted only after 
  the unobserved situations are joined, improving speed. Moreover, the 
  name of the unobserved stages are stored as `name_unobserved` in the 
  staged tree object.
* update internal function `new_label` to improve speed.
* `plot.sevt` allows now to set edges color with 
   `col_edges`.
* In `plot.sevt` and `barplot.sevt` it
  is possible to specify stages that should be ignored
  and not plotted via the `ignore` argument, by default the 
  `name_unobserved` stages are ignored.
* `plot.sevt` adds variables names by default (`var_names` argument).
* fix in `compare_stages`: because of changes in `plot.sevt` 
  we need to specify that the root is always considered identical.
* internal function `stndnaming` accepts now `uniq`, `prefix` and  
  `ignore` arguments, which control how stage names are generated and   
  if some stage names should be left untouched (default: the `name_unobserved`
  stages). 
* in `stages_bj` (previously `bj.sevt`) distance is now passed with a 
  character and no longer as a function.
* two new model selection function: `stages_hclust` and 
  `stages_kmeans`, to learn stage structure using hierarchical or        
  k-means clustering.
*  all model selection functions accept `scope` and `ignore`   
   parameters that allow to specify among which variables
   run the algorithm and which stages should be left untouched 
   (default: the `name_unobserved` stages). 
*  replace `1:length(x)` with the suggested `seq_along` in all code.
* distance names in `stages_bj` and `stages_hclust` are compatibles.
* fixed bug in some probability distance functions when 0 probabilities. 
* Conversion generic function `as.sevt`, only implemented one method 
  for `bn.fit` class from bnlearn package
* fix `inclusions_stages` and provide better output. 

# 1.0.2

* fix bug in `summary`, stages were wrongly matched to probabilities
* new function `barplot_stages` to draw barplots of the 
  floret probabilities. Implemented relative tests.
* new example in `plot.sevt`.
* now `order` can be passed to `staged_ev_tree.bn.fit`
* `join_zero` alias for `join_zero_counts` 
* more tests 

# 1.0.1

* fix `indep`, probabilities should not be of class table 
  (it was triggering a bug in summary)
* fix `subtree`, now removing unused probabilities 
  (it was triggering a bug in summary) 
* fixing testing without long double 
* fixing some errors in testing
* update some tests with unquoted expression 
* new functions `get_stage` and `get_path` and relative tests

# 1.0.0

* Minor doc fix and references added
* `xor` is renamed as `noisy_xor`
* test added for `noisy_xor`
* more util functions marked as internal
* fixed return problem with `NaN` log-probabilities in `predict.sevt`
* `summary.sevt` function added
* `subtree.sevt` works now for fitted objects

# 0.9.5

* Add `inclusion.stages` function
* Fix #28; `predict.sevt` now returns conditional probabilities P(C|X)
* Fix #62; `predict.sevt` works also if `newdata` does not include the class

# 0.9.4

* Fix #40; `compare.sevt` works with three different methods.
* Fix #37; `join_stages` throws error with bad stages.
* Fix #51; tests for model selection functions.

# 0.9.3 

* Fix #39; `lambda = 0` does not induce errors in `logLik`, `join_stages` and thus in the model selection algorithms.  
* Fix #41;  `nvar.sevt` bug 
* Fix #34; order of elements in positions list of `ceg.sevt`
* Fix #38  subtree and colors in plot bugs 
* Fix #46; removed Trump dataset

# 0.9.1

* New functions: `varnames.sevt` and `nvar.sevt` 
* Improved codecov 
* `fit.sevt` is replaced by `sevt.fit` (following the `lm.fit` naming). 
  `fit.sevt` is still available but marked as (DEPRECATED) in doc.
* minor bug fixing
* Doc for `compare.sevt` is updated with info on the capabilities.
