# dev

* possible to skip checks in development.
* `hamming_stages` earns a new argument `FUN` which specify how to aggregate 
   across variables. The default `FUN = sum` produces the standard hamming 
   distance between stages structures.
* new function `copy_sevt` to copy objects of class sevt.
* `predict` for `sevt` objects can now predict also with
   incomplete inputs (either NA or not provided).
* some fixes in `prob`.
* `sevt_fit`, `full` and `indep` add a new component to the sevt obejct,
   the field `data_raw` which stores the data used to fit the model.
   This is useful when missing data are present.
* New stages learning algorithm for missing data, `stages_em` implements
  the structural EM algorithm for stages structure.
* `sevt_fit_em` implements the hard EM algorithm for parameter
  learning with missing data.
* some fixes in `plot` related utilities.
* functions to plot and handle ALDAGs:
  `as_igraph.parentslist` and `plot.parentslist`
  allowing easy plotting of ALDAGs.
* function to find one or all topological order of a `parentslist` object.
* some changes of internal functions of the `parentslist` class.
* `make_stages_col` accept now as `col` a function of 0, 1, or 2 arguments 
   (it is checked with `length(formals(col))``). 
* function `potential_outcomes` to compute the probability of an outcome 
  variable given intervention on a treatment.
* new method for coloring in `make_stages_col` or `plot.sevt`. If `col = classic` 
  the "classical" coloring of stages is generated, where singleton stages are not 
  assign a color and where stages across different levels are assigned different 
  colors.
* `stages_hclust` will now use the `hclust` implementation in the
   **fastcluster** package, if available. 
* `stages_hclust` accepts now a custom function as distance.

# 2.3.0

* Carli et al. 2022 JSS citation added in DESCRIPTION.
* Added functions for random generation of staged trees: `random_sevt` and
`random_parentslist`.
* Added new function `depsubtree` which build the dependency subtree.

  when ignoring stage "1" which is assigned to root
* Fix #80; `sevt_fit` earns the `scope` argument,
  it is now possible to do partial re-fit of staged tree models.
  Moreover, with the `compute_logLik` argument, the
  user can decide if the log-likelihood should be computed when fitting the
  model.
* `stages_hclust` can now search the best cut of the hierarchical cluster with
   respect to some `score` function to be maximized.
* various minor fixes in colors specification for visualization functions.
* `stages_simplebhc` implements a new stage structure search by iterative
  joining of positions, thus searching in the space of simple staged trees.

  where positions and stages are equivalent.

  than two variables.

  a new dedicated class `sevt.stgs`.

# 2.0.0

This version introduces major changes, in functions capabilities
and in functions naming.
These changes are almost surely breaking any previous code
using older versions of the package.
In particular, all functions named `*.sevt` but class methods are now
called differently.
Moreover, various improvements and functionalities are added
to better deal with unobserved situations and to improve
computations.
Additional model selection methods based on clustering are
now available.

COMPLETE CHANGELOG:

* DESCRIPTION updated.
* documentation updated.
* improve code comments.
* reduced exported functions.
* removed the `fit` parameter from `full`, `indep`.
   Now `full` and `indep` always fit the model while
  `sevt` is just the basic constructor of the `sevt` class.
* in `full` and `indep` by default unobserved situations are joined
  using `join_unobserved`, and probabilities are fitted only after
  the unobserved situations are joined, improving speed. Moreover, the
  name of the unobserved stages are stored as `name_unobserved` in the
  staged tree object.
* update internal function `new_label` to improve speed.
* `plot.sevt` allows now to set edges color with
   `col_edges`.
* In `plot.sevt` and `barplot.sevt` it
  is possible to specify stages that should be ignored
  and not plotted via the `ignore` argument, by default the
  `name_unobserved` stages are ignored.
* `plot.sevt` adds variables names by default (`var_names` argument).
* fix in `compare_stages`: because of changes in `plot.sevt`
  we need to specify that the root is always considered identical.
* internal function `stndnaming` accepts now `uniq`, `prefix` and
  `ignore` arguments, which control how stage names are generated and
  if some stage names should be left untouched (default: the `name_unobserved`
  stages).
* in `stages_bj` (previously `bj.sevt`) distance is now passed with a
  character and no longer as a function.
* two new model selection function: `stages_hclust` and
  `stages_kmeans`, to learn stage structure using hierarchical or
  k-means clustering.
*  all model selection functions accept `scope` and `ignore`
   parameters that allow to specify among which variables
   run the algorithm and which stages should be left untouched
   (default: the `name_unobserved` stages).
*  replace `1:length(x)` with the suggested `seq_along` in all code.
* distance names in `stages_bj` and `stages_hclust` are compatibles.
* fixed bug in some probability distance functions when 0 probabilities.
* Conversion generic function `as.sevt`, only implemented one method
  for `bn.fit` class from bnlearn package
* fix `inclusions_stages` and provide better output.

# 0.9.4

* Fix #37; `join_stages` throws error with bad stages.
* Fix #51; tests for model selection functions.
